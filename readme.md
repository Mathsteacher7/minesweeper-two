# minesweeper-two

## Why?

I have decided to create my old projects from the course but play a bit with the technology.

Since this game is with Vanilla JS, the technology to play with here was chatGPT.

## The process

I ask chatGPT to write me the code for the Minesweeper game using only HTML, CSS and JS. Surprisingly, the results were not horrible the first time, but I still had a few bugs. For example, I saw all the numbers right away, and I had an infinite loop of losing the game, no matter what tile I clicked on. 

Therefore, I started to ask the chat for smaller assignments, explaining in simple English what the problem was; in some cases, it produced a whole new JS file, but in other cases, it suggested only the relevant function it wanted me to update.

## Time

The whole process took about 45 minutes, not very long, but not too short.

## Monitoring the process

In the end, did I need to know how to code to achieve what I have done? Yes, but at a low level.
I started with Bard, but the results were pure from the HTML file. Nevertheless, my knowledge helped me identify the problem immediately and understand how far it is from a valid solution.
With chatGPT, my knowledge helped me understand the suggested solutions, although I did not give any instructions in professional language.
We are still at the point where a completely non-tech person can write the code, but this is not that far away. The chat did not tell me if they replaced the whole code or just a specific function, so I needed to be able to read the syntax. It also did not tell me where to put a new function when it created one. Therefore, more than some knowledge was needed here for the process to work.

## Summary

That was a great experience asking the chat to do a whole task, not just to help me solve a small problem, as I have used it until now. It also assures me what I am thinking and what most experts say - this will not replace the developer, but allow us to be more efficient, quicker and maybe, with time, make fewer mistakes.
